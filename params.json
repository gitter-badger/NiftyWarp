When listing warps,\r\n  private warps will only show up in their owner's lists.  When warping, only the owner will be able to warp to\r\n  that named warp.\r\n\r\n\"unlisted\"\r\n- When listing warps, unlisted warps will only show up the their owner's lists.  However, when using warps, anyone\r\n  can use the warp.  If the warp has the same name as one the owner has, you can use it by typing the fully qualified \r\n  name of the warp.  This warp type is useful if you want create useful warps to places that you can let your friends \r\n  know about, but that aren't important enough to clutter up everyone's list with.\r\n\r\n\"listed\"\r\n- This type of warp is able to be seen and used by anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMANDS AND ALIASES\r\n---------------------------------\r\nIn order to be able to function alongside other warp plugins, all of the main commands are unique to NiftyWarp and prefixed\r\nwith \"nw\". However, for ease of use, I've also included quite a few common and intuitive aliases. Here are the commands\r\nlisted using the aliases people are most likely to use. Below them are the main command and other alternates if you need to\r\nuse this in conjunction with another addon.\r\n\r\n/addwarp <warpName>\r\nAdd a warp\r\n- Command:    /nwadd\r\n- Alternates: /nwa, /addwarp, /createwarp, /setwarp\r\n\r\n/deletewarp <warpName>\r\nDelete a warp\r\n- Command:    /nwdelete\r\n- Alternates: /nwd, /deletewarp, /removewarp\r\n\r\n/sethome\r\nSet your home warp (currently just makes a warp named \"home\")\r\n- Command:    /nwhomeset\r\n- Alternates: /nwhs, /homeset, /sethome\r\n\r\n/home\r\nWarp to your home (currently just warps to your \"home\" warp)\r\n- Command:    /nwhome\r\n- Alternates: /nwh, /home\r\n\r\n/listwarps <worldName> <private | unlisted | listed>\r\nGet the list of warps\r\n- Command:    /nwlist\r\n- Alternates: /nwl, /listwarps\r\n\r\n/renamewarp <warpName> <newWarpName>\r\nRename an existing warp\r\n- Command:    /nwrename\r\n- Alternates: /nwr, /renamewarp\r\n\r\n/setwarptype <warpName> private | unlisted | listed\r\nSet the privacy/visibility of a warp after creation\r\n- Command:    /nwset\r\n- Alternates: /nws, /settype, /setwarptype\r\n\r\n/warp <warpName>\r\nUse a warp\r\n- Command:    /nwwarp\r\n- Alternates: /nw, /nww, /warp\r\n\r\n/warptocoord x y z <worldName>\r\nWarp to a specific coordinate\r\n- Command:    /nwwarptocoord\r\n- Alternates: /nwwtc, warptocoord, wtc, w2c\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARPING:\r\n---------------------------------\r\nAll warps have an owner.  When attempting to use a warp that belongs to someone else, you may have to use the fully \r\nqualified name which is <owner>.<warpname> ... this situation only occurs when a warp that someone else owns has the \r\nsame name as one that you own.  For listed warps, this will be obvious due to how it is listed.  However when \r\nattempting to use unlisted warps, you may have to take this into account on your own.  For instance, if I want to use \r\nan unlisted warp called \"foo\" that is owned by niftymonkey, I would type:\r\n\r\n    /nwwarp niftymonkey.foo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFIGURATION:\r\n---------------------------------\r\nCurrently there are only a few configuration options.  They are stored in the <pluginsDir>/NiftyWarp/NiftyWarp.yml file\r\n\r\nmessages:\r\n\r\n    # this specifies whether or not to prefix all the NiftWarp-related messages with: [NiftyWarp] -\r\n    # values: true | false  (defaults to true)\r\n    show-prefix: true\r\n\r\n    # this specifies whether or not to show the user a message when they don't have the proper permission set\r\n    # this message also indicates the exact permission that needs to be set in order to use that command\r\n    # this is intended to be a helper message for determining which permission is needed to use that command\r\n    # values: true | false  (defaults to true)\r\n    permissions:\r\n        show-fail-message: true\r\n\r\n\r\nwarps:\r\n\r\n    # this specifies the type to use when creating new warps without specifying the type\r\n    # values: private | unlisted | listed  (defaults to unlisted)\r\n    default-type: unlisted\r\n\r\n    # this specifies the maximum number of warps to allow a user to create\r\n    # value: a number  (defaults to 20)\r\n    max-warps: 20\r\n\r\n\r\npermissions:\r\n\r\n    # this specifies whether or not to attempt to use the permissions plugin.
