DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT NOTES:
---------------------------------

Here is a high-level rundown of how to setup your environment for NiftyWarp development.  
This is written based on the tools I have chosen for developing, and use of any other 
tools is up to you.  If I have time later I may write a more "step-by-step" failproof
version of this document.  For now, here's the basic rundown from memory.


SOFTWARE LIST

* IntelliJ IDEA 10.5 Community Edition
  - http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

* Maven 2.2.1
  - http://maven.apache.org/download.html
  - http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

* Craftbukkit Server 0.0.1
  - http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server

* Bukkit API
  - http://bukkit.org

* Git/Github
  - http://github.com



BASIC DEV ENVIRONMENT SETUP STEPS:

* Install IntellJ if you haven't already done so

* Install Maven

* Install Craftbukkit Server
  - I also ran it to make sure it worked before I start messing around with it with this plugin
  Note:  I had to run it twice before it worked for me.  Seemed like it generated everything it needed
         in the directory the first time, and the second time it just started up the server

* Download the Bukkit API, and install it
  - Since we're using Maven, and I can't find a repository for tbe bukkit dependency,
    just download it and go to the folder you downloaded the bukkit api into, and 
    type the following:
  
    mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.bukkit -DartifactId=bukkit -Dversion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=bukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

* Install Git and pull the latest from the repository

* Open IntelliJ and "Open Project..." and select the pom.xml from the top level project directory

* [Optional] Create a properties file to support the dev profile used to deploy the jar for testing on your server.
  - Create a niftywarp-1.0-beta.properties file in your <user.home>/dev/properties folder and place the following property in it
  
    minecraft.server.dir=<path to your craftbukkit server directory>

  - The "1.0-beta" part of the property file name needs to match the version of the project in the pom.xml
  - If you do this step, you'll need to select the "dev.install.jar" profile

* Run a maven clean/install and you should have the jar in your <minecraft.server.dir>/plugins directory
