Nifty Warp is a server-side plugin (built on bukkit) that allows for private, listed, unlisted warps.


WARP TYPES:
---------------------------------
"private"
- This is the default type of a warp if no type parameter is used when adding a warp.  When listing warps, private warps will only show up the their owner's lists.  When warping, only the owner will be able to warp to that named warp.

"unlisted"
- When listing warps, unlisted warps will only show up the their owner's lists.  However, when using warps, anyone can use the warp by typing the fully qualified name of the warp.  This type is useful if you want create useful warps to places that you can let your friends know about, but you don't want to clutter up everyone's list.

"listed"
- This type of warp is able to be seen and used by anyone.


COMMANDS AND ALIASES
---------------------------------
Here's the simple list.  See the usage for complete details.

Add a warp
- Command:     nwadd
- Alternates:  nwa, addwarp, createwarp, setwarp

Delete a warp
- Command:     nwdelete
- Alternates:  nwd, deletewarp, removewarp

Get the list of warps
- Command:     nwlist
- Alternates:  nwl, listwarps

Rename an existing warp
- Command:     nwrename
- Alternates:  nwr, renamewarp

Set the privacy/visibility of a warp after creation
- Command:     nwset
- Alternates:  nws, settype, setwarptype

Use a warp
- Command:     nwwarp
- Alternates:  nw, nww, warp


WARPING:
---------------------------------
All warps have an owner.  When attempting to use a warp that belongs to someone else, you may have to use the fully qualified name which is <owner>.<warpname> ... this situation only occurs when a warp that someone else owns has the same name as one that you own.  For listed warps, this will be obvious due to how it is listed.  However when attempting to use unlisted warps, you may have to take this into account on your own.  For instance, if I want to use an unlisted warp called "foo" that is owned by niftymonkey, I would type:

    /nwwarp niftymonkey.foo


CONFIGURATION:
---------------------------------
Currently there are only a few configuration options.  They are stored in the <pluginsDir>/NiftyWarp/NiftyWarp.yml file

# message-related options
messages:

    # this specifies whether or not to prefix all the NiftWarp-related messages with: [NiftyWarp] -
    # values: true | false  (defaults to true)
    show-prefix: true

    # this specifies whether or not to show the user a message when they don't have the proper permission set
    # this message also indicates the exact permission that needs to be set in order to use that command
    # this is intended to be a helper message so that it's easy to determine which permission is needed to use that command
    # values: true | false  (defaults to true)
    permissions:
        show-fail-message: true

# warp-related options
warps:
    # this specifies the type to use when you are creating new warps without specifying the type with the type parameter
    # value: private | unlisted | listed  (defaults to unlisted)
    default-type: unlisted
